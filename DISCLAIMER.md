# Legal Disclaimer

**READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## Not Legal Advice

This software (the "Tool") is provided for **informational and research purposes only**. It does **NOT** constitute professional legal advice, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

### What This Means

- **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship
- **No Professional Responsibility**: The authors and contributors assume no professional responsibility for decisions made based on information from this Tool
- **Verification Required**: ALL legal information, citations, and conclusions must be independently verified with official sources and qualified legal professionals before being relied upon

## Professional Use Warnings

### For Legal Professionals

If you are a lawyer, legal researcher, or other legal professional:

- **Malpractice Risk**: Relying on unverified information from this Tool in professional legal work may constitute professional malpractice
- **Professional Obligations**: You remain solely responsible for verifying all citations, statutes, and legal positions before advising clients or filing documents
- **Professional Rules**: Members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) and officers of the Supreme Court must comply with the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA) and applicable Supreme Court Circulars when using AI tools
- **Client Disclosure**: Consider whether professional ethics rules require disclosing AI tool use to clients

### Duty of Independent Verification

**YOU MUST VERIFY EVERYTHING.** Do not cite, quote, or rely on any provision, case law, or legal interpretation from this Tool without:

1. Checking the official source (Official Gazette at officialgazette.gov.ph, LawPhil, and Supreme Court E-Library)
2. Verifying the provision is currently in force and has not been amended or repealed
3. Reading the full context of cited provisions
4. Consulting Supreme Court decisions and legislative deliberations for interpretation
5. Considering how recent legal developments may affect the matter

## Data Authority and Limitations

### Source Authority

This Tool aggregates data from official Philippine legal databases. However:

| Source Type | Authority Level | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Official government databases (Official Gazette, Supreme Court E-Library)** | Authoritative | Statute text (primary reference) |
| **Community/open-data sources (LawPhil, ChanRobles)** | Supplementary | Case law, cross-references (verify independently) |
| **Treaty/international databases** | Authoritative for international law | International obligations metadata |

**CRITICAL**: Community-maintained resources are **NOT** official government publications. While generally reliable, they may contain transcription errors, outdated information, or incomplete coverage.

### Commercial Legal Databases

For professional legal work, **always cross-check with commercial legal databases** such as:

- Supreme Court E-Library, CDA (CD Asia), LexisNexis Philippines, SCRA (Supreme Court Reports Annotated)

These services provide editorial oversight, comprehensive annotations, and professional-grade currency guarantees that this Tool **cannot** provide.

## Currency and Staleness

### No Real-Time Updates

- Database updates are **manual** and may lag official publications by **weeks or months**
- Philippine law changes continuously through new Republic Acts, executive orders, Supreme Court decisions, and administrative issuances
- **Last-updated timestamps** in tool responses indicate data age, but should be treated as unreliable

### Staleness Warnings

The Tool includes staleness warnings when data is >30 days old. **These warnings are not exhaustive**:

- Even "fresh" data may be outdated if recent amendments were published
- Staleness warnings do not guarantee completeness or accuracy
- Always check official sources for the current legal position

### Amendments and Repeals

- A provision marked "in force" may have been:
  - Amended after the last database update
  - Repealed but not yet removed from the database
  - Subject to implementing rules and regulations (IRR) affecting its applicability
  - Declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court
- The Tool does **NOT** automatically track amendments in real-time

## Coverage Gaps

### What's Missing

This Tool does **NOT** include:

1. **Complete case law** -- Coverage of Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and lower court decisions is limited
2. **Historical statute versions** -- Limited availability of historical provision wording
3. **Legal commentary** -- No editorial annotations, academic commentary, or practice guides
4. **Unpublished decisions** -- Lower court decisions and administrative issuances largely absent
5. **Full legislative history** -- Limited coverage of committee reports, sponsorship speeches, and bicameral conference records
6. **Local government ordinances** -- Municipal, city, and provincial ordinances are not covered
7. **Implementing rules and regulations (IRR)** -- Agency-level implementing rules may be incomplete
8. **Indigenous peoples' law** -- Customary law of indigenous cultural communities may not be covered

### Impact on Professional Use

These gaps mean:

- **Incomplete Legal Research**: Tool results are inherently incomplete and may miss critical authorities
- **Context Missing**: Without commentary and legislative deliberations, interpretation may be incorrect
- **Local Government Blind Spots**: National legislation is prioritized; local government ordinances may differ
- **IRR Gaps**: Without complete implementing rules, the practical application of statutes may be unclear
