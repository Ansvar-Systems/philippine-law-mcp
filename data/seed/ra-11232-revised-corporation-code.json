A dispute shall be nonarbitrable when it involves criminal offenses and interests of third parties.\nThe arbitration agreement shall be binding on the corporation, its directors, trustees, officers, and executives or managers.\nTo be enforceable, the arbitration agreement should indicate the number of arbitrators and the procedure for their appointment. The power to appoint the arbitrators forming the arbitral tribunal shall be granted to a designated independent third party. Should the third party fail to appoint the arbitrators in the manner and within the period specified in the arbitration agreement, the parties may request the Commission to appoint the arbitrators. In any case, arbitrators must be accredited or must belong to organizations accredited for the purpose of arbitration.\nThe arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on its own jurisdiction and on questions relating to the validity of the arbitration agreement. When an intra-corporate dispute is filed with a Regional Trial Court, the court shall dismiss the case before the termination of the pretrial conference, if it determines that an arbitration agreement is written in the corporation�s articles of incorporation, bylaws, or in a separate agreement.\nThe arbitral tribunal shall have the power to grant interim measures necessary to ensure enforcement of the award, prevent a miscarriage of justice, or otherwise protect the rights of the parties.\nA final arbitral award under this section shall be executory after the lapse of fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof by the parties and shall be stayed only by the filing of a bond or the issuance by the appellate court of an injunctive writ.\nThe Commission shall formulate the rules and regulations, which shall govern arbitration under this section, subject to existing laws on arbitration."
