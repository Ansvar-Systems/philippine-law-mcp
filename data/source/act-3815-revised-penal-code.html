<p>Felonies are committed not only by means of deceit (dolo) but also means of fault (culpa).</p>

<dir>
<p class="jn">1. By any person committing a felony (delito) although the wrongful act done be different from that which he intended.</p>

<p class="jn">In the same way the court shall submit to the Chief Executive, through the Department of Justice, such statement as may be deemed proper, without suspending the execution of the sentence, when a strict enforcement of the provisions of this Code would result in the imposition of a clearly excessive penalty, taking into consideration the degree of malice and the injury caused by the offense.</p>
<p class="jn"><b>Article 6.</b> <i>Consummated, frustrated, and attempted felonies.</i>-Consummated felonies, as well as those which are frustrated and attempted, are punishable.</p>
<p class="jn">A felony is consummated when all the elements necessary for its execution and accomplishment are present; and it is frustrated when the offender performs all the acts of execution which would produce the felony as a consequence but which, nevertheless, do not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrator.</p>
<p class="jn">There is an attempt when the offender commences the commission of a felony directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance.</p>
<p class="jn"><b>Article 7.</b> <i>When light felonies are punishable.</i>-Light felonies are punishable only when they have been consummated, with the exception of those committed against persons or property.</p>
<p class="jn"><b>Article 8.</b> <i>Conspiracy and proposal to commit felony.</i>-Conspiracy and proposal to commit felony are punishable only in the cases in which the law specially provides a penalty therefor.</p>
<p class="jn">A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.</p>
<p class="jn">There is proposal when the person who has decided to commit a felony proposes its execution to some other person or persons.</p>
<p class="jn"><b>Article 9.</b> <i>Grave felonies, less grave felonies and light felonies.</i>-Grave felonies are those to which the law attaches the capital punishment or penalties which in any of their periods are afflictive, in accordance with article 25 of this Code.</p>
<p class="jn">Less grave felonies are those which the law punishes with penalties which in their maximum period are correctional, in accordance with the above mentioned article.</p>
<p class="jn">Light felonies are those infractions of law for the commission of which the penalty of arresto menor or a fine not exceeding 200 pesos or both, is provided.</p>
<p class="jn"><b>Article 10.</b> <i>Offenses not subject to the provisions of this Code.</i>-Offenses which are or in the future may be punishable under special laws are not subject to the provisions of this Code.

<p class="jn">2. The same rule shall apply with respect to any aggravating circumstance inherent in the crime to such a degree that it must of necessity accompany the commission thereof.</p>
<p class="jn">3. Aggravating or mitigating circumstances which arise from the moral attributes of the offender, or from his private relations with the offended party, or from any other personal cause, shall only serve to aggravate or mitigate the liability of the principals, accomplices and accessories as to whom such circumstances are attendant.</p>
<p class="jn">4. The circumstances which consist in the material execution of the act, or in the means employed to accomplish it, shall serve to aggravate or mitigate the liability of those persons only who had knowledge of them at the time of the execution of the act or their cooperation therein.</p>

<p class="jn">3. When only an aggravating circumstance is present in the commission of the act, they shall impose the penalty in its maximum period.</p>
<p class="jn">4. When both mitigating and aggravating circumstances are present, the court shall reasonably offset those of one class against the other according to their relative weight.</p>
<p class="jn">5. When there are two or more mitigating circumstances and no aggravating circumstances are present, the court shall impose the penalty next lower to that prescribed by law, in the period that it may deem applicable, according to the number and nature of such circumstances.</p>
