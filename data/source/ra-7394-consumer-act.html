<p align="justify"><b>Article 68. <i>Additional Provisions on Warranties.</i></b> &#8211; In addition to the Civil Code provisions on sale with warranties, the following provisions shall govern the sale of consumer products with warranty:</p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">a)	Terms of express warranty. &#8211; Any seller or manufacturer who gives an express warranty shall:</p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">1)	set forth the terms of warranty in clear and readily understandable language and clearly identify himself as the warrantor;</p>
<p align="justify">2)	identify the party to whom the warranty is extended;</p>
<p align="justify">3)	state the products or parts covered;</p>
<p align="justify">4)	state what the warrantor will do in the event of a defect, malfunction of failure to conform to the written warranty and at whose expense;</p>
<p align="justify">5)	state what the consumer must do to avail of the rights which accrue to the warranty; and</p>
<p align="justify">6)	stipulate the period within which, after notice of defect, malfunction or failure to conform to the warranty, the warrantor will perform any obligation under the warranty.</p>
</dir>
<p align="justify">b)	Express warranty &#8211; operative from moment of sale. &#8211; All written warranties or guarantees issued by a manufacturer, producer, or importer shall be operative from the moment of sale.</p>
<dir>
<p align="justify">1)	Sales Report. &#8211; All sales made by distributors of products covered by this Article shall be reported to the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the product sold within thirty (30) days from date of purchase, unless otherwise agreed upon. The report shall contain, among others, the date of purchase, model of the product bought, its serial number, name and address of the buyer. The report made in accordance with this provision shall be equivalent to a warranty registration with the manufacturer, producer, or importer. Such registration is sufficient to hold the manufacturer, producer, or importer liable, in appropriate cases, under its warranty.</p>
<p align="justify">2)	Failure to make or send report. &#8211; Failure of the distributor to make the report or send them the form required by the manufacturer, producer, or importer shall relieve the latter of its liability under the warranty: Provided, however, That the distributor who failed to comply with its obligation to send the sales reports shall be personally liable under the warranty. For this purpose, the manufacturer shall be obligated to make good the warranty at the expense of the distributor.</p>
<p align="justify">3)	Retail. &#8211; The retailer shall be subsidiarily liable under the warranty in case of failure of both the manufacturer and distributor to honor the warranty. In such case, the retailer shall shoulder the expenses and costs necessary to honor the warranty. Nothing therein shall prevent the retailer from proceeding against the distributor or manufacturer.</p>
<p align="justify">4)	Enforcement of warranty or guarantee. &#8211; The warranty rights can be enforced by presentment of a claim. To this end, the purchaser needs only to present to the immediate seller either the warranty card of the official receipt along with the product to be serviced or returned to the immediate seller. No other documentary requirement shall be demanded from the purchaser. If the immediate seller is the manufacturer's factory or showroom, the warranty shall immediately be honored. If the product was purchased from a distributor, the distributor shall likewise immediately honor the warranty. In the case of a retailer other than the distributor, the former shall take responsibility without cost to the buyer of presenting the warranty claim to the distributor in the consumer's behalf.</p>
<p align="justify">5)	Record of purchases. &#8211; Distributors and retailers covered by this Article shall keep a record of all purchases covered by a warranty or guarantee for such period of time corresponding to the lifetime of the product's respective warranties or guarantees.</p>

</dir>
<p align="justify">The warrantor will not be required to perform the above duties if he can show that the defect, malfunction or failure to conform to a written warranty was caused by damage due to unreasonable use thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">e)	Duration of warranty. &#8211; The seller and the consumer may stipulate the period within which the express warranty shall be enforceable. If the implied warranty on merchantability accompanies an express warranty, both will be of equal duration.</p>
<p align="justify">Any other implied warranty shall endure not less than sixty (60) days nor more than one (1) year following the sale of new consumer products.</p>
<p align="justify">f)	Breach of warranties. &#8211; 1) In case of breach of express warranty, the consumer may elect to have the goods repaired or its purchase price refunded by the warrantor. In case the repair of the product in whole or in part is elected, the warranty work must be made to conform to the express warranty within thirty (30) days by either the warrantor or his representative. The thirty-day period, however, may be extended by conditions which are beyond the control of the warrantor or his representative. In case the refund of the purchase price is elected, the amount directly attributable to the use of the consumer prior to the discovery of the non-conformity shall be deducted.</p>
